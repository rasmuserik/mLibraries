This document gives an overview of mobile development platforms, and ideas about how DBC may approach mobile development.
The purpose is both to follow up on the meeting at DBC on our mobile strategy, and also to give input to a (nordic) collaboration on open source mobile library applications, as a continuation of Helsinki Midwinter Darkness Camp 2011.

The document contains the following:
- Platforms, market shares and segmentation
- Mobile JavaScript
- Suggested approach

## Executive summary

## Frameworks
### jQueryMobile
